1. How long did you spend on the coding test? What would you add to your solution if you had more time? If you didn't spend much time on the coding test then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.
```
I spent around 5-6 hours completing this assignment. If I were to spend more time on this, I would 
implement lazy loading for the table. That in my mind would make interactions a bit more seemless and clean.
```
2. What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen language? Please include a snippet of code that shows how you've used it.
```
It wasn't added in the latest version of the language but is still a nice feature of es6. It is Promises. Promises make it really convenient writing 
asynchronous code.
```
```
export function fetchRestaurants(searchObj) {
  const { city, page } = searchObj;
  const queryStr = queryString.stringify({ city, page });
  return fetch(`http://opentable.herokuapp.com/api/restaurants?${queryStr}`, {
    method: 'GET',
  }).then((resp) => {
    return resp.json();
  }).then((respJson) => {
    return respJson;
  })
}
```

3. How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?
```
I have used chrome development tools before to track performance issues in a React app. It let's you record the timeline while you are doing some
interactions on the page. After that it provides a nice detailed view with frames rendered on the page, memory usage, etc. I used it before to track
the memory leak on a project I'm working on at Atomicreach.
```
4. How would you improve the API that you just used?
```
I was pretty happy with how that API works.
```
5. Please describe yourself using JSON.
